# PostBox

### Creates a basic **Post Box** app interface with two sections: a left section for posting and a right section for displaying posts. The left section contains a form with a textarea for entering posts, along with a submit button. The right section displays existing posts, each with options to edit or delete them. The **CSS** styles the layout, and the **JavaScript** handles form submission, form validation, post creation, deletion, and editing.
